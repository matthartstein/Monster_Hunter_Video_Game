A video game developed with Python and PyGame.

- Users control a character that is capable of fighting different enemies..
- Both enemies and user character's health bar accurately represents current health in real time.
- Potions can be acquired to completely heal the health of the user's player.
- Still need to implement "End Game" code when user defeats all characters or dies.
- Would also like to add missions, different levels, and a story line.
